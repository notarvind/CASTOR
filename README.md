CASTOR Plots

I've written a script for the CASTOR Plots based on Dr. Matt's email. I've gotten the code up and running and it's giving me a plot and the fluxes - but the flux for each band seems way too low (it is many orders below the total flux or total luminosity). I've included the script in the python file and some typical plots with values for each band below.

The temperature I used in this script is a median temperature from the 500 temperatures I calculated using the formula in the Arnett paper coupled with the blackbody equation, given the inputs of radius ranging from 500 - 1000 solar radii.
